# Tritron Hardware Provisioner

This repository contains the Tritron Bluetooth Mesh Provisioner app.

## Assets

Application images and icons are stored under `bluetooth_mesh_hardware_provisioner/assets/`.
- Place logos in `assets/images`.
- Place icon files (used for the Windows title bar) in `assets/icons`.

These assets are registered in `pubspec.yaml` so Flutter can bundle them at build time.

When adding the company logo `remoticom_logo.png`, consider scaling the height to around **40–60 px** so the width remains crisp while fitting the app bar. The favicon (`favicon.png`) should typically be **32 × 32 px** or **48 × 48 px** for high-resolution displays.
