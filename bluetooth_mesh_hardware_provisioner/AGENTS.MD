# CODEX

- Always add the file path and name as the first line in a file.
- implement fixes for FIXME.md
- implement TODO's and placeholders in FIXME.md
- Write out indomatic code documentation comments
- Check if there is a Functional/USER Requirement Specification (FRS/URS) document and use it as a guide for implementation and feature completeness.
- Keep the architecture documentation (`architecture.md`) and guides in `docs/` in sync with the current implementation.
- When new features are added or modified, update the corresponding FRS/URS files so requirements stay accurate.
- Use existing Flutter functionality as much as possible.
